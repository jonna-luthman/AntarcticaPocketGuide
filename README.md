# ANTARCTICA POCKET GUIDE

## A mobile application in webview built with React/Ionic and Supabase with the purpose so serve as a digital handbook for Antarctica.

The purpose of the app is to create a digital handbook for Antarctica. The app's primary content will be educational facts and information specifically about Antarctica's wildlife. It is designed to be a simple, easy-to-use tool intended mainly for visitors to the continent, helping them easily access information and tips to maximize their experience.

## Project status: MVP (version 1.0)
This application is currently in its MVP (Minimal Viable Status) phase.
The primary focus for the first application has been to establish a solid foundation for:
- Secure authentication and user profile syncronization.
- Core educational content delivery for Antarctic wildlife.
- Architecture for multilanguage support.

As an MVP, the project prioritizes stability and clean architecture over a large feature set, serving as a "proof of concept" for a digital handbook.

## Tech stack
- Frontend: React, Typescript, Ionic Framework
- Native Bridge: Capacitor
- Backend/Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Build tool: Vite
- Localization: i18next (Multi-language support)
- Communication: Supabase Edge Functions

## How to install the application
Prerequisites:
- Access to the private repository on Github
- Node.js installed
- Xcode (for iOS development) and Android Studio (for Android development)
- Supabase CLI (for Edge functions development)

1. Clone the repository from gitHub
2. Install dependencies: Run 'npm install' in your terminal.
3. Setup keys: Create an .env file in the source directory and add following keys:
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL='your-url'
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY='your-anon-key'
    RESEND_API_KEY='your-resend-key'
4. Run development server: Run 'npm run dev' in your terminal

## Architecture and structure
The project follows a modular strcucture to separate logic from UI.
Source folder (/src):
- /api - Functions for direct communication with Supabase
- /assets - Static files like images and icons not hosted on Supabase Storage.
- /components - Reusable UI elements and sub-components to keep page files manageable.
- /constants - Centralized constants and mappings for database Enums.
- /context - Global state management (Auth, Loading)
- /hooks - Custom hooks for business logic, data fetching, and i18n logic.
- /mappers - Data transformation logic that formats raw API/database responses into clean objects for the frontend.
- /pages - Main view components mapped to the application routes.
- /theme - Global CSS variables, styling, and Ionic theme overrides.
- /types - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions.
- /utils - Pure helper functions for filtering, date formatting, and data manipulation.

Styling strategy
- Ionic Utilities: We prioritize Ionic’s built-in CSS classes for layout and standard spacing to keep the codebase lean.
- Modular CSS: For specific or complex designs, we use CSS Modules to ensure style encapsulation and prevent global scope pollution.
- Organization: Custom stylesheets are not created for every file—only when specific styling is required. In those cases, the .module.css file is located within a styles/ subdirectory inside the corresponding component or page folder.
- Theming: Global design tokens, CSS variables, and Ionic theme overrides are centrally managed in src/theme/.

Backend and Build folders:
- supabase/functions - Edge Functions (Deno) handling server-side logic (e.g., Resend email integration).

- dist/ - The production-ready web bundle generated by the build process (npm run build).
- ios/ and android/ - Native platform projects managed by Capacitor. Open these in Xcode or Android Studio.

## Mobile workflow
To sync your webchanges to the anive mobile projects:
1. Build the web project: 'npm run build'
2. Sync with Capacitor: 'ionic cap sync' (syncronizes both ios and android)
3. Open the native IDE: 'ionic cap open ios' or 'ionic cap open android'

## Localization (i18n)
The app is designed to be multi-lingual. For the moment is available in English and Spanish.
- Storage: Translation files are located in src/utils/locales/.
- Structure: Each supported language has its own subfolder (/en, /es) conatining a translation.json file.
- Json files: Using nested objects to group translations by feature
    e.g "pages": { "home": {"title": "Welcome"} }
- Usage: Translations are accessed using the useTranslation (and useGetLang ) hook throughout the application.
